# Session Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Context:** Building and validating the AI Chatbot Demo App defined in `PRD.md`.

---

## Repository & Filesystem Summary
- Project root: `/mnt/c/Users/boiangiu/Desktop/chat_app`
- Key subdirectories created/updated:
  - `backend/` - FastAPI backend (config, models, services, API routers, tests)
  - `frontend/` - React + Vite frontend (components, API client, styling)
  - `config/` - JSON configuration files for models, MCP servers, RAG, personas, secrets
  - `data/uploads/` - Upload storage directory (currently empty after cleanup)
  - `tests/` - Basic API smoke test script (`tests/test_api.py`)
- SQLite database file: `app.db` in project root (currently recreated but **still empty of users** due to seeding issue).

## What Was Implemented
1. **Backend (FastAPI) features**
   - Config schema validation with Pydantic models (`backend/app/core/config.py`).
   - Async SQLite setup via SQLAlchemy + `aiosqlite`; database schema covering users, sessions, messages, uploads, RAG assets, trace runs/steps, config cache.
   - Authentication endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/me`) with JWT issuance.
   - Session/message APIs implementing chat creation, message posting, editing, RAG retrieval stubs, MCP tool simulation, tracing.
   - Tracing endpoints (`/traces/...`) for run summaries and detailed step data.
   - Config endpoint (`/config`) and Ollama models endpoint (`/models`).
   - Seed script intended to insert five demo users.
   - Utility services for security, RAG, MCP, tracing, and config caching.

2. **Frontend (React + Vite)**
   - Login form pre-filled with demo credentials.
   - Workspace UI with chat list, chat detail, RAG/MCP toggles, tool runner, activity drawer for traces.
   - Integration with backend REST endpoints via Axios client.
   - Styling consistent with F5 branding (#E21D38) and UX requirements.
   - Production build confirmed via `npm run build`.

3. **Tooling & Deployment**
   - `backend/requirements.txt`, Dockerfiles for backend/frontend, and `docker-compose.yml` prepared for containerized runs.
   - `tests/test_api.py` smoke test exercising login → session → message → trace flow (requires seeded users to pass).

## What We Tried & Current Obstacles
- **SQLite Seeding Issue:**
  - `app.db` was removed to trigger reseeding; backend restarted successfully but `users` table remains empty (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;` returns 0).
  - Without seeded users, `/auth/login` responds `{
